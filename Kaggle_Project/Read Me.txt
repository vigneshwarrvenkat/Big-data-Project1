The Following are the classes present in the src folder:
The source folder also contains the data files in the Image.orig. All the file path for the program is hard coded within the files.

All libraries are within the project..

BlobDemo: This is a primary Blob detection library to detect the blobs in image

BlobFinder:This is the driverfor the BlobDemo.

ColorExtraction:This library helps in extracting the color of the image.

Compare:This is a driver class for Color Comparison.

Contour: This library helps in finding the contour of the image.

ContourComparator:This compares the original contour and the contour which is painted for finding the number of cavities in the image.

FeatureExtraction:This is driver class which calls all the methods which extracts the features from the image.

FindContours:This is another JAVA library for finding the contours.

GenerateTree: This is a part of tree generation for random forest.

HarrisFast:This library helps in detecting the number of Edges in the image.

HarrisTest:This is the driver for the edge detection class.

Histogram:This helps in converting the input image into a Histogram

OpenCV:The OpenCV for driving the features.

RandomForest:The class which generates the forest of trees based on the training data.

ReadInput:This reads the input for the random forest tree generation from the features generated.

Retrieval:This is the main class which drives the whole project.

RGBFrame:The RGBFrame is used for the Blob detection.

TextureExtraction:This library is used for finding the texture(gradients) fo the image.

TreeNode:This is the basic file for the Tree generation in the random forest.
