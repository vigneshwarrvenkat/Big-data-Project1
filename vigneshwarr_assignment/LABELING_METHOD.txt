As per the assignment, I have planned to determine the directionality of USD dollar against CAD dollar.I have derived four features namely:
The average of the every minute of the BID value

The average of the every minute of the ASK value

The Max of the BID value during the one minute period.

The Min of the BID value during the one minute period.

The Max of the ASK value during the ONE minute period.

The Min of the ASK value during the ONE minute period.

Based on this, i try to predict two labels ie Directionality of the bid price of USD dollar against CAD dollar.
and the directionality of the ask price of USD dollar against CAD dollar.


Predicting the label: LABEL_BID

 when the average value of bid
* for one minute is less than the next average value of one minute and-
* When the max value of bid for one minute is less than the next max value for one minute, the LABEL_BID becomes true.
* else LABEL_BID becomes false


Predicting the label: LABEL_ASK

when the average value of ask
* for one minute is less than the next average value for one minute and-
* When the average of max value of ask for one minute is less than the average of next max value for one minute, the LABEL_ASK becomes true.
* else LABEL_ASK becomes false
