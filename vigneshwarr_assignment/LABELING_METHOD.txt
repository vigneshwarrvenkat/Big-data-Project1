As per the assignment, I have planned to determine the directionality of USD dollar against CAD dollar.I have derived four features namely:
The average of the every minute of the BID value

The average of the every minute of the ASK value

The Max of the BID value during the one minute period.

The Min of the ASK value during the ONE minute period.

Based on this, i could predict two labels ie Directionality of the USD dollar against CAD dollar.
and the timeperiod during which  the directionality increases or decreases.

As we know that the ask value would be more than the bid value, when the average of the bid value or the ASK value increases consequently for 2 min, the directionality is 1.

when the average of the bid value or the ASK value decreases consequently for 2 min, the directionality is 0.

Comparing the max and the min value:
If the max value and the min value at a particular minute increases, the directionality is 1.

If the max value and the min value at a particular minute decreases, the directionality is 0.
