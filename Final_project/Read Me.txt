TfIdf.java - This file calculates the TF-IDF for the text input from the files. It is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The tf-idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document.

Document.java -Class that represents a text document
 that keeps track of the number of times a word appears in the document, it's term frequency, and eventually, its inverse document frequency (if used with TfIdf) for finding important keywords in the document.It is called in the TfIdf.java

D3.java - The class that reads the co-occurences from the reducer and provides the output file in the format of flare json which is used for visualization.

Driver.java - This is the main file which initiates the mapreduce process.

Map.java - This is the Mapper class which overrides the map method. It instantiates the Tfidf class and get the input from the class.

Reduce.java - This is the reducer class which overrides the reduce method to reduce to single key values and aggregates the count of all the terms.

Json.java - This is the class which I used initially to write in normal flat Json format. Later D3 library was used to write to flare json format.

Index.html: This is the file which I used for the data visulaization. I ran it in local host.

d3.v3.min: The java script library for the D3 visualization.

Library: 
Attribute SelectionTest: This is another library used to preprocess the input text files.
